## 1. Description
Generates random passwords according to the types of characters (i.e. numeric, special, uppercase, lowercase) the user chooses.

### Note:
For design and usability, I chose not to have dialog boxes.

### Summary of functionality
- the user can select checkboxes to determine which types of characters they would like in their password
- the user can enter in the input box how many characters they would like in their password (8 through 128)
- the user can copy the created password by clicking a button in the upper right corner
